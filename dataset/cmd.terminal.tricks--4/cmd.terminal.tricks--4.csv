1,Btn14,Shut Down or Restart Another Computer System administrators in a business environment do this all the time for lots of reasons but you can also shut down or restart another computer on your network all from your computer's Command Prompt. The easiest way to shut down a computer remotely is to executeshutdown /i from the Command Prompt which will open the Remote Shutdown Dialog shown here. Just enter the name of the remote computer (which you can get by running the hostname command on the other PC) choose what you want to do (restart or shutdown) select some other options and then click OK. So whether you're brushing up on your command skills or just scaring a family member this Command Prompt trick is a fun one. You can also shut down or restart another computer strictly from the Command Prompt with the shutdown command without using the Remote Shutdown Dialog.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
2,Btn36,Create Undelete-able Folders You can create undeletable folders using specific set of keywords. In the Command Prompt type the name of the drive where you want to create the folder (it must not have Windows installed in it). After that type any of these keywords “md con or “md lpt1 and press Enter. So it should look something like this “D: md con. This will create a folder with the same name that could not be deleted or renamed. To delete the folder replace “md con with “rd con or “md lpt1 with “rd lpt1.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
3,Btn41,Open Command Prompt in a Folder When you open the command prompt it opens up in either User or System folder depending upon whether you ran it as administrator or not. Now the thing is if you want to execute a file in any particular folder you would have to use the change directory(cd) command to navigate to the folder which can be a problem if the directory is nested way too deep. To ease things you can open the folder in your Windows Explorer hold Shift key when you right-click in the folder and select Run command window here to directly open the CMD prompt with the path to that folder directly.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
4,Btn15,Tab to Auto-complete To save your time on typing the whole command simply press Tab key to cycle through all the files and folders in the current folder. If you type a few keys and then start pressing Tab it will cycle through files and folders that match what you have just typed. That’s pretty cool.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
5,Btn31,Execute Multiple Commands You can easily execute one command after another by provide all the commands and putting “&&” between each command (may save some time). For example you can type “ipconfig && dir” to execute both commands one after another.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
6,Btn20,Find a Website's IP Address Like to know the IP address of a website? There are a few different commands you can use to find it. Let's use the nslookup command to find the IP address of About.com. Just execute nslookup about.com and view the result. Make sure you don't confuse anyprivate IP addresses that also show up in the nslookup results alongside About.com's public IP address. Another way to find a site's IP address is to use the ping command. Execute ping about.com and then look at the IP address between the brackets in the results shown. Using either Command Prompt trick the result is 207.241.148.80.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
7,Btn44,See Command History You can see last used commands in a session using the navigation buttons but if you would like to see a list of all the commands you can get it by pressing the F7 button. Alternatively you can use the command doskey /history to list these commands in the command prompt itself.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
8,Btn29,Use QuickEdit Mode Command Prompt comes with QuickEdit Mode to quickly copy and paste content with just your right-click. In QuickEdit mode you can highlight content and right-click to copy it or right-click in a blank area to paste content from the clipboard (if there is any). To enable QuickEdit Mode right-click on the top of the Command Prompt interface (where exit button is located) and select “Properties”. In the properties check the checkbox next to “QuickEdit Mode” to enable it (you will have to disable it later).,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
9,Btn35,Change Command Prompt Color You can also change command prompt color to make it look less dull and a bit easy on the eyes. To do so right-click at the top corners of Command Prompt and select “Properties” from the menu. In the properties navigate to “Colors” tab and you will find all the options to change color of both text and background.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
10,Btn16,View Your Computer's Important Network Information Maybe just for your own information but certainly when you're troubleshooting a network or Internet problem you'll probably at some point need to know details about your computer's network connection. Everything you'd want to know about your network connection is available somewhere in the Control Panel in Windows but it's much easier to find and much better organized in the results from the ipconfig command. Open Command Prompt and execute ipconfig /all. What displays on screen next is everything important about your network connection: your IP addresshostname DHCP server DNS information and much much more. Combine this hack with Command Prompt Trick #7 and you've got a very easy way to get information about your connection to someone helping you with a problem.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
11,Btn8,Save a Command's Output to a File An incredibly useful Command Prompt trick is the use of redirection operators specifically the > and >>operators. These little characters let you redirect the output of a command to a file giving you a saved version of whatever data the command produced in the Command Prompt window. For example let's say you're about to post a computer problem to an online forum and you want to provide really accurate information about your computer. An easy way to do that would be to use the systeminfo command with a redirection operator. For example you might execute systeminfo > c:ycomputerinfo.txt to save the information provided by the systeminfo command to a file. You could then attach the file to your forum post.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
12,Btn32,Check Default Programs You can check which applications are used to open specific types of programs. For this purpose just type “assoc” in the Command Prompt and hit enter. You will see all the extensions and their associated program that opens them written next to them.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
13,Btn10,Customize the Command Prompt Title Bar Text Tired of that Command Prompt title bar text? No problem just use the title command to hack it say whatever you like. For example let's say your name is Maria Smith and you want to express your ownership of the Command Prompt: execute title Property of Maria Smith and the Command Prompt's title bar will change immediately. The change won't stick so the next time you open Command Prompt the title bar will be back to normal. The title command is usually used to help give a custom appearance in script files and batch files... not that I'm saying titling it with your name isn't a good idea!,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
14,Btn23,10: Taskkill The taskkill command terminates a task either by name (which is referred to as the image name) or by process ID. The syntax for this command is simple. You must follow the taskkill command with -pid (process ID) or -im (image name) and the name or process ID of the task that you want to terminate. 9: Tasklist The tasklist command is designed to provide information about the tasks that are running on a Windows 7 system. At its most basic you can enter the following command: The tasklist command has numerous optional switches but there are a couple I want to mention. One is the -m switch which causes tasklist to display all the DLL modules associated with a task. The other is the -svc switch which lists the services that support each task. Here's how they look: 8: Repair-bde If a drive that is encrypted with BitLocker has problems you can sometimes recover the data using a utility called repair-bde. To use this command you will need a destination drive to which the recovered data can be written as well as your BitLocker recovery key or recovery password. The basic syntax for this command is: You must specify the source drive the destination drive and either the rk (recovery key) or the rp (recovery password) switch along with the path to the recovery key or the recovery password. Here are two examples of how to use this utility: 7: Ipconfig The ipconfig command is used to view or modify a computer's IP addresses. For example if you wanted to view a Windows 7 system's full IP configuration you could use the following command: Assuming that the system has acquired its IP address from a DHCP server you can use the ipconfig command to release and then renew the IP address. Doing so involves using the following commands: Another handy thing you can do with ipconfig is flush the DNS resolver cache. This can be helpful when a system is resolving DNS addresses incorrectly. You can flush the DNS cache by using this command: 6: Pathping Ping does a good job of telling you whether two machines can communicate with one another over TCP/IP but if a ping does fail you won't receive any information regarding the nature of the failure. This is where the pathping utility comes in. Pathping is designed for environments in which one or more routers exist between hosts. It sends a series of packets to each router that's in the path to the destination host in an effort to determine whether the router is performing slowly or dropping packets. At its simplest the syntax for pathping is identical to that of the ping command (although there are some optional switches you can use). The command looks like this: 5: Ping Ping is probably the simplest of all diagnostic commands. It's used to verify basic TCP/IP connectivity to a network host. To use it simply enter the command followed by the name or IP address of the host you want to test. For example: Keep in mind that this command will work only if Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic is allowed to pass between the two machines. If at any point a firewall is blocking ICMP traffic the ping will fail. 4: Nslookup The nslookup tool can help you to verify that DNS name resolution is working correctly. When you run nslookup against a host name the tool will show you how the name was resolved as well as which DNS server was used during the lookup. This tool can be extremely helpful when troubleshooting problems related to legacy DNS records that still exist but that are no longer correct. To use this tool just enter the nslookup command followed by the name of the host you want to resolve. For example: 3: Driverquery Incorrect device drivers can lead to any number of system problems. If you want to see which drivers are installed on a Windows 7 system you can do so by running the driverquery tool. This simple command-line tool provides information about each driver that is being used. The command is: If you need a bit more information you can append the -v switch. Another option is to append the -si switch which causes the tool to display signature information for the drivers. Here's how they look: 2: File Signature Verification One way to verify the integrity of a system is to make sure that all the system files are digitally signed. You can accomplish this with the File Signature Verification tool. This tool is launched from the command line but uses a GUI interface. It will tell you which system files are signed and which aren't. As a rule all the system files should be digitally signed although some hardware vendors don't sign driver files. The command used to launch the File Signature Verification tool is: 1: System File Checker Malicious software will often attempt to replace core system files with modified versions in an effort to take control of the system. The System File Checker can be used to verify the integrity of the Windows system files. If any of the files are found to be missing or corrupt they will be replaced. You can run the System File Checker by using this command: 10 Windows 7 commands every administrator should know,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
15,Btn19,Automatically Complete Commands with Tab Completion Tab completion is another Command Prompt trick that can save you lots of time especially if your command has a file or folder name in it that you're not completely sure of. To use tab completion in the Command Prompt just enter the command and then the portion of the path that you do know if at all. Then press the tab key over and over to cycle through all of the available possibilities. For example let's say you want to change directories to some folder in theWindows directory but you're not sure what it's named. Type cd c:indowsnd then press tab until you see the folder you're looking for. The results cycle or you can use Shift+Tab to step through the results in reverse.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
16,Btn7,Get Help for Any Command Believe it or not the help commanddoes not provide help for every Command Prompt command. However any command can be suffixed with the /? option usually called the help switch to display detailed information about the command's syntax and often times even some examples. I doubt that the help switch is the coolest Command Prompt trick you've ever heard of but it's hard to disagree that it's one of the more useful. Unfortunately neither the help command nor the help switch offer much in the way of explaining how to interpret the syntax. See How To Read Command Syntax if you need help with that.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
17,Btn33,Get PC Drivers List You can open list of all the drivers installed on your PC with just a single command. Just type “driverquery” in the Command Prompt and press Enter.

18,Btn4,Run Command Prompt as an Administrator Automatically Many commands require that you execute them from an elevated Command Prompt in Windows - in other words execute them from a Command Prompt that's run as an administrator. You can always right-click on any Command Prompt shortcut and choose Run as administrator but creating a shortcut to do the same thing can be a huge time saver if you're a frequent Command Prompt power user. To complete this Command Prompt trick just create a Command Prompt shortcut on the desktop enter the shortcut's properties and then select the Run as administrator box located in the Advanced button on the Shortcut tab.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
19,Btn3,View a Command's Results One Page (or Line) at a Time Ever run a command like the dir command that produces so much information on the screen that it's almost useless? You're not alone. One way around this is to execute the command in a special way so whatever information is generated is shown to you one page or one line at a time. To do this just type the command the dir command for example and then follow it with the pipe redirection operator and then the more command. For example executing dir /s | more will generate the thousands of lines of results that you expect from the dir command but the more command will pause each page of results with -- More -- at the bottom of the page indicating that the command is not done running. Just press the space bar to advance by page or press the Enter key to advance one line at a time.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
20,Btn1,What is Command Prompt Used For? Command Prompt is used to execute entered commands. Command Prompt is most commonly used to execute batch files perform advanced administrative functions and troubleshoot and solve certain kinds of Windows issues. What is Command Prompt? Command Prompt is acommand line interpreterapplication available in most Windows operating systems. Command Prompt is officially called Windows Command Processor but is also sometimes called the command shell or by its file name cmd.exe. Note: Command Prompt is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "the DOS prompt" or as MS-DOS itself. Command Prompt is a Windows program that emulates many of the command line abilities available in MS-DOS but it is not actually MS-DOS.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
21,Btn12,Open the Command Prompt From Any Location If you've ever worked in the Command Prompt for very long you know that it can be really frustrating executing the cd/chdir command over and over again to get to the right directory you want to work from. Luckily there's a super easy Command Prompt trick that will let you open a Command Prompt window from whatever folder you're viewing in Windows. All you have to do is navigate in Windows to the folder you want to start working from in the Command Prompt. Once there hold down your Shift key while youright-click anywhere in the folder. Once the menu pops up you'll notice an entry that's not usually there: Open command window here. Click it and you'll start a new instance of the Command Prompt ready and waiting at the right location! If you're a Command Prompt power user you'll immediately recognize the value in this little trick.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
22,Btn43,Execute Multiple Commands You don’t have to wait for a command to finish processing before you could add another you can easily enter multiple commands and they will be executed one after another. All you have to do is type “&&” between each command to separate them like “ipconfig && dir && assoc”. Now the command will be executed as soon as the last one finishes.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
23,Btn22,Watch Star Wars Episode IV Yes you read that correctly you can watch an ASCII version of the full Star Wars Episode IV movie right in the Command Prompt window! Just open Command Prompt and execute telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl. The movie will start immediately. This isn't a terribly productive use of the Command Prompt nor is it really a trick of the Command Prompt or any command but it sure is fun! Note: The telnet command is not enabled by default in Windows 7 or Windows Vista but can be turned on by enabling Telnet Client from Windows Features in the Programs and Features applet in Control Panel. If you'd rather not enableTelnet but would like to see the movie you can also watch it in your browser here.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
24,Btn26,Save a Command to a File If you want to save results of a command to a .txt for future reference then it is quite easy as well. All you need to do is add “> (destination/file name with .txt extension)” at the end of the command you are about to execute. For example you can type “ipconfig > c:etworkdetails.txt” this command will create a .txt file in C drive with name “Networkdetails”.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
25,Btn40,Create Wi-Fi Hotspot using Command Prompt You don’t need any third-party apps to create a Wi-Fi hotspot to share your PCs internet you can easily do so from the Command Prompt. In the Command Prompt enter the following command to enable Wi-Fi Hotspot. “netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=Hotspotname key=password” Once enabled you can start the Wi-Fi hotspot by entering the command “netsh wlan start hostednetwork” or stop it by entering the command “netsh wlan stop hostednetwork“. You will also need to share your internet connection to this hotspot for everyone to use. Go to “Network and Sharing” option from the “Control Panel” and then click on “Change adaptor settings” in the left panel. Here right click on the internet connection you are using and click on “Properties“. In the properties go to sharing tab and check the option “Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s internet connection” to share your internet connection. Note: Using Administrator privileges for CMD is must to run this command otherwise it will show an error.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView

27,Btn9,View a Drive's Entire Directory Structure I think one of the neatest little commands is the tree command. With tree you can create a kind of map of the directories on any of your computer's drives. Execute tree from any directory to see the folder structure under that directory. Tip: With so much information it's probably a good idea to export the results of the tree command to a file. For example tree /a > c: reeresults.txt.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
28,Btn17,Map a Local Folder Just Like a Network Drive The net use command is used to assign shared drives on a network to your own computer as a drive letter but did you know there's another command that can be used to do the same thing to any folder on any of your local hard drives? There is and it's called the subst command. Just execute the subst command followed by the path of the folder you wish to appear as a drive. For example let's say you want your C:indowsonts folder to appear as the Q: drive. Just execute subst q: c:indowsonts and you're set! This Command Prompt trick makes accessing a particular location from the Command Prompt much easier.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
29,Btn27,Copy Data from the Command Prompt Copying data from the Command Prompt isn’t just a Ctrl+C away the process is actually different. It is not that hard just right click anywhere in the window and click on “Mark” from the menu. After that just select the text you want to copy and hit Enter to copy it. Important Note: With Windows 10 Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V commands to copy/paste has been enabled in Command Prompt. So you don’t need to follow the above process if you are using Windows 10. Also In Windows 10 keyboard shortcuts for CMD are enabled by default which wasn’t the case with earlier version of Windows.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
30,Btn34,Scan System Files The system files can also be scanned and repaired from the Command Prompt. Type “sfc/scannow” and press enter the scan will start and may take quite some time depending on your PC speed (up to an hour may be). It will either automatically repair the files or let you know if there is a problem and provide its details.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView

32,Btn42,Enable QuickEdit for Easy Copy/Paste One thing I miss the most in Command Prompt is the ability to easily copy and paste text using the conventional Windows hotkeys. Normally one would have to use the right-click context menu options to copy and paste text but if you enable QuickEdit you can do them using simple shortcuts. To enable the QuickEdit mode right-click on the Command Prompt Title Bar and select Properties. In the Properties Window under the Option Tab enable QuickEdit Mode. That’s all; you can now quickly select text by dragging your mouse pointer. Pressing the enter key on the selected text will copy the text to the clipboard and a simple left click would be enough to paste the text.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView

However if you just know in which drive or folder the required folder is located then you can cycle through all the folders to reach it. To do this just type specified drive and start press TAB key on your keyboard to cycle through all the folders inside it.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
36,Btn21,Copy & Paste Easier with QuickEdit Mode How about an even easier way to copy from the Command Prompt? And a secret way to easily paste? Just right-click on the Command Prompt title bar and selectProperties. On the Options tab in the Edit Options section check theQuickEdit Mode box and then click OK. Enabling QuickEdit Mode is like having Mark enabled all the time so selecting text to copy is really easy. But it also enables an easy way to paste into the Command Prompt: just right click once and whatever is in the clipboard is pasted in the Command Prompt window. Normally pasting involves right-clicking and selecting Paste.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
37,Btn6,Run Commands Simultaneously You can put && between two commands and execute them one after another. The command on the left will execute first followed by the command on the right of the double ampersand.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
38,Btn38,Hide Files and Folders using Command Prompt You can hide folder with the help of Command Prompt that cannot be accessed using the traditional hide feature of Windows. To do this type the drive name where the folder is located and then enter this command “Attrib +h +s +r” and afterwards enter the name of the file/folder you want to hide. So it should look something like this “D: Attrib +h +s +r haider”. If the folder is inside another folder then the command must come before the folder/file you want to hide not just after the Drive name. To again see the folder use the same process above but change the command to “Attrib -h -s -r” from “Attrib +h +s +r”.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
39,Btn13,Drag and Drop For Easy Path Name Entry Most Command Prompt commands require you or have options to specify full paths to files or folders but typing out a long path can be frustrating especially when you miss a character and have to start over. For example in Windows 7 the path to the Accessories group in my Start Menu isC:sersimppDataoamingicrosoftindowstart Menurogramsccessories. Who wants to type that all in manually? Not me. Luckily there's a Command Prompt trick that makes this much easier: drag and drop. Just navigate to the folder you want the path for in Windows Explorer. Once there drag the folder or file to the Command Prompt window and let go. Like magic the full path is inserted saving you a considerable amount of typing depending on the length and complexity of the path name. Note: Unfortunately the drag and drop feature does not work in an elevated Command Prompt.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
40,Btn45,Copy Commands Output to Clipboard Directly Sometimes one might want to copy the output from a command to clipboard like at times when you get an error and you want to paste the exact error in email or while chatting with someone. To store a command output to a clipboard add the command | clip at the end of the command. For e.g. Dir /p | clip,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
41,Btn39,Compare Two Files You can also compare two text files in command prompt and see the difference. The results won’t be as good as third-party available file comparison tools but it is worth a shot and fun do! All you need to do is type “FC” command and then enter directories of both text files (the files must be in .txt format for proper working). For example you can type “fc C:aiderample1.txt C:aiderample2.txt” and hit enter to get comparison of both files with answer such as files are different or both files are identical. In the above example “C:” is the drive where text file is located “haider” is the name of the folder in which the text file in located and “Sample1.txt” is name of the text file. Both files can be located anywhere in your PC you just need to provide the right directory. If both the files have different content then running this command will show the different content and if both the files have exact same content the command will return this message ‘no difference encountered’.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
42,Btn25,Show all PC Drivers If you would like to see all the drivers installed in your PC then you can easily do so right from the Command Prompt. Just open the Command Prompt and type “driverquery”. When you will hit Enter key you will see a big list of all the drivers installed along with information such as Driver name Module name Type of driver and Link data.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
43,Btn2,Use Ctrl-C to Abort a Command Just about any command can be stopped in its tracks with the abort command: Ctrl-C. If you haven't actually executed a command you can just backspace and erase what you've typed but if you've already executed it then you can do a Ctrl-C to stop it. Warning: Ctrl-C isn't a magic wand and it can't undo things that aren't undoable like a partially complete format command. However for things like the dir command that seem to go on forever or questions you're asked at the prompt that you don't know the answer to the abort command is an excellent Command Prompt trick to know.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
44,Btn46,Drag and Drop Files to Change Path If you are already in command prompt and you want to copy the exact path to a folder or file to run the file or change the present working directory you can simply drag and drop the file or the folder on the command prompt. The path of the dropped file or folder will show up in quotes.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
45,Btn11,Copy From the Command Prompt what if you do just want to copy a short section of text to the clipboard? It's not too hard but it's not very intuitive either. Right-click anywhere in the Command Prompt window and choose Mark. Now highlight with your left mouse button whatever you'd like to copy. Once your selection is made press Enter. Now you can paste that information into whatever program you'd like.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
46,Btn18,Access Previously Used Command with the Arrow Keys Another great Command Prompt trick has to be the use of the keyboard arrow keys to cycle through previously executed commands. The up and down arrow keys cycle through the commands you've entered and the right arrow automatically enters character by character the last command you executed. This might not sound that interesting but there are several situations where the arrow keys become huge time savers. Consider this example: You've typed out 75 characters of a command and then try to execute it only to find that you forgot to add an option at the very end. No problem just hit the up arrow and the entire command is automatically entered in the Command Prompt window ready for you to edit to make it work.,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.LinearLayout com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView android.widget.TextView com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
