2,b7,It is quite a long period you have not written a single letter. However we have received a letter from your English teacher Mr. A D .We are much shocked to have the report that you have failed in the first terminal examination/pretest examination. You are a meritorious student. You won the scholarship in the junior scholarship examination. How do you cut a sorry figure in the examination? You know all of us expect something unique from you. Oh! You have greatly disappointed us. We suspect that you are wasting your valuable time mixing with bad companies foolishly. But this will ruin you. You should think about your future. Remember time once gone will never be got back. Student life is said to be the seedtime of life. As you sow so will you read? Remember you have to stand on your own feet. If you do not use your time properly and study well it will bring sorrows and sufferings to you. I also want to remind you that we come of a middle class family .Our educational expenses are borne with great difficulty by our parents. So do not be insincere and inattentive. Study well. You should never mix with bad companies. With love and best wishes.

9,b6,My Salam to you and mother. Hope you all are keeping well by the grace of almighty. I am also well. I have not heard any news for a long time. I could not write to you during the long period. But today I could not but write to you to tell you good news. You will be glad to know that I stood first in the final Model test of our school. You know I could not do very well in the pre-test examination. But after it was over I began to study vigorously. I got 80% marks only in Mathematics .I thought about it seriously. I found no subject hard to me. Earlier I did not study on any subject very seriously except Mathematics. Before our test examination I studied very well for two months. Every day I started to study at 6:30 p.m. closing the door of my reading room and continued up to 12:00 (midnight) with a gap of 20 minutes for supper in the middle. Every morning I checked what I learnt the previous night through writing. I just placed the questions on the table and wrote their answers within a fixed time. After that I myself assessed them with the help of the answers prepared earlier by my subject teachers. You can say I was in deep study while night and I sat for exam in every morning. The practiced helped me so much that I have done quite well in the Model test held after the test examination of our school. I can assure you that if God wishes I can fulfill your expectation in the coming examination. Now I am quite hopeful of having my SSC result with GPA 5.In the final Model Test I got grade point 5 in every subject. And in my most favorite subjects Mathematics and Physics I got 100 and 97 marks respectively. This is all about how I prepared for the coming SSC examination. Convey my Salam to mother and love to the younger.

In it you have wanted to know my experience of taking food in a restaurant. You will feel charm to know that I had an experience of taking food in a Chinese restaurant last Friday. Actually on that day the feast was arranged for my cousin’s marriage ceremony at the canton restaurant Mouchack Dhaka. I along with my elder sister Sharmin entered the restaurant. A good flavor was tickling my nose. There was a dim light in every room. I kept looking around and listening to the fine music.However we soon had our seats to eat and got astonished when the foods were served. A good number of delicious foods like chicken mutton pawn fried rice etc. were served one after one another. There were also Thai soup corn soup curry and what not.

11,b5,At first my love to you. I hope you are keeping well. I have just received your letter. I am glad to learn that you are preparing yourself for the ensuring SSC examination. I hope you will do a brilliant result in the examination. This time is the best time to be prepared for the ensuring examination. You know now days there is a bad tendency among the students not to study but to adopt unfair means in the examination. It cannot make them perfect. It will not be able to offer them real education. But I would like to make you cautious that you should never try to adopt unfair means in the examination. It is really crime which spoils a student forever. One may pass the examination by adopting unfair means but his future life is full of darkness. This is one thing that will break down their career .If they cannot pass first time they can try next. I think failure is more acceptable than adopting unfair means. Follow my advice and you will be succeeded and benefited. No more to day. Convey my regards to parents and love to the younger.

13,b12,I would like to share my experience of the air journey with you. My first flight is a memorable event of my life. I received a letter from my uncle at Chittagong together with a plane ticket. He asked me to go there and stay with them for a couple of days. The ticket was a Fokker flight on September 30 2004. I reached the Zia international Airport about one hour before the flight. I had my ticket checked and my luggage weighed and took the boarding card. After about fifteen minutes the flight was announced. Going along with other passengers towards the tarmac I boarded the plane. My seat was by the side of a window. Just in front of me there was a sign with the words: fasten your seat belt. No smoking.” After a few minutes the plane moved along the run way and then began to take off. I saw outside. The houses below looked like doll houses the paddy fields looked like green carpets and the rivers appeared as broad lines on a drawing sheet. The air hostess came with a tray in her hand and gave some light and delicious refreshments. In about 40 minutes the plane landed at Chittagong Airport and we came to our journey’s end. It was an enjoyable that filled my heart with thrill and excitement. It brought a change and recreation in my monotonous life. No more today.
