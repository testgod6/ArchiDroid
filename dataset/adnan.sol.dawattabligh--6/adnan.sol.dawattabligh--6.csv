1,ImanActivity,IMAN INCIDENTS : Once Hadrat Talha (Radiallahu anhu) was seen sitting in a sad mood. Somebody asked him why was he so sad. He replied “I heard from Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) that he knew the word which if recited by a dying person at the time of his death brings relief from the pangs of death so that his face brightens and he dies in happiness. Unfortunately I could not enquire about these words from Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and therefore I am feeling unhappy.” Hadrat Umar (Radiallahu anhu) said that he knew those words. Hadrat Talha (Radiallahu anhu) joyously asked what those were. Hadrat Umar (Radiallahu anhu) said “We know that no words are better than the Kalimah which was offered by Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) to his uncle Abu Talib and it is la ilaha illallah.” Hadrat Talha (Radiallahu anhu) said “By ALLAH it is this. By ALLAH it is this.” (Virtues of Zikr Ch.2 Hadith 25 Pg 137)Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said “Once Nabi Musa (Alayhi asalat wassalam) prayed to Almighty ALLAH to teach him some forms of Zikr for his remembrance. He was advised to recite la ilaha illallah.” He submitted “O my Sustainer! I want something special exclusively meant for me.” Then Almighty ALLAH said “If the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed in one pan of the balance and the Kalimah la ilaha illallah in the other the latter will outweigh the former.” (Virtues of Kalimah Tayyibah Ch.2 Hadith1Pg 107)There is a story of a Kafir king who was extremely cruel and bigoted against the Muslims. As he had caused a lot of suffering to the Muslims they were naturally very revengeful. They put him in a cauldron placed on a fire. At first he besought his idols for help but finding no response from them he became a Muslim and started continuous recitation of la ilaha illallah. How sincerely and devotedly he must have been reciting can well be imagined. At once help came from Almighty ALLAH in the form of heavy rain which extinguished the fire and cooked the cauldron. It was then followed by powerful cyclone which carried away the cauldron and dropped it in a city inhabited by non-believers. He was still engaged in the recitation of the Kalimah. The people were wonder struck by this scene and after listening to this story all of them also embraced Islam.( Fadailul Aamal virtues of Zikr Ch.2 Pg 135 Hadith 23)Hadrat Abdullah bin Amar Ibnul A’s (Radiallahu anhu) says “Once we were accompanying the Prophet on a journey. I went to see him and I was wearing a saffron colored sheet. He said to me “What is this that you are wearing?” I felt that he did not like me wearing a dress of that color. When I reached home I found a fire burning in the hearth. I threw my garment into the fire. The next day when I went to the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) he inquired “Where is that sheet?” I told him what I had done with it. He remarked “You could have given it to one of the ladies in your house. Women are permitted to wear clothes of that color.”Abdullah (Radiallahu anhu) was so much perturbed at Rasulullah’s displeasure that he did not hesitate to avail at the first opportunity of doing away with the sheet that caused the displeasure of Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He did not even think of some other use of the garment. If we had been in his place we would have thought of some excuse or the other for keeping it or at least finding some other use for it. (Stories of Sahabah Ch 9 Story No. 1 Pg 160)Hadrat Wa’il Ibn Hajar (Radiallahu anhu) says “I once visited the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) when the hair on my head was long. While I was sitting with him he uttered the words “Aubab aubab” (meaning something evil or ominous). I thought he was referring to my hair. I returned home and had my hair cut. The next day when I again went to him he said “I never referred to your hair when I uttered those words yesterday and now it is good that you had your hair cut.”This shows the frame of mind of those people. They tolerated no delay in acting upon the wishes of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) whether they understood it tightly of wrongly. They never thought it necessary to further inquire or clarify. (Stories of Sahabah Ch 9 Story No 4 Pg 163)A young nephew of Hadrat Abdullah Ibn Mughaffal (Radiallahu anhu) was playing “Khazaf.” He said to him “O nephew! Stop doing that. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) has prohibited this play. It can neither shoot a bird nor harm an enemy. It is likely to injure somebody’s eye or tooth. The boy stopped playing but after sometime when he thought that his uncle was not watching him he started doing it again. Hadrat Ibn Mughaffal (Radiallahu anhu) was very angry and said “How dare you do a thing after knowing that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) has forbidden it? By ALLAH! I will never speak to you again. I will never visit you when you are sick nor join your funeral if you die during my lifetime.”“Khazaf” is a game in which a pebble is placed on the thumb and then thrown with the force of the other fingers. Children are fond of playing such games. Hadrat Ibn Mughaffal (Radiallahu anhu) could not tolerate his nephews ignoring the words of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Do we know the instructions of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) about many things we ate wont to do from morning till evening? How much regard do we have in our hearts for his verdict? Let everybody ponder over it himself and answer. (Stories of Sahabah Ch 9 Story No.8 Pg 166)Observe their spirit of carrying out the orders of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) under very adverse and trying conditionsMay ALLAH favor us with such a spirit of obedience even though we do not deserve it.

2,SalahActivity,SALAH VIRTUES : Hadrat Abu Zar (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that once Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) came out of his house. It was autumn and the leaves were falling off the tree. He caught hold of a branch of a tree and its leaves began to drop in large number. At this he remarked “O Abu Zar! When a Muslim offers his Salah to please ALLAHhis sins are shed away from him just as these leaves are falling off this tree.” (Virtues of Salat Part1(A) Hadith No.2Pg12)Hadrat Abu Hurairah (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that once Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) asked his companions “Do you believe that dirt can remain on person bathing five times a day in a brook running in front of his door?” “No!” replied the companions. “No dirt can remain on his body.” Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) remarked “So exactly similar is the effect of Salah offered five times a day. With the grate of ALLAH it washes away all sins.” (Virtues of Salat part I(a) Hadith No.4Pg 15)Hadrat Jabir (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “The likeness of five times daily Salat is as the likeness of a deep brook running is front of the door of a person who bathes therein five times a day.”(Virtues of Salat PartI (a) Hadith No.4 (a)Pg 15)Hadrat Anas (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “When a person offers his salah at its fixed hours with proper Wudu with humility and submission and with Qiyam Ruku and Sajdah done satisfactorily then such a Salah rises up in a bright and beautiful form and bless the person in words “May ALLAH guard you as you have guarded me.” On the other hand if a person is not punctual with his Salah nor does he perform Wudu Qiyam Ruku and Sajdah properly then the Salah rises up in an ugly and dark shape and curses the person saying: “May ALLAH ruin you as you have ruined me!” It is then flung back like a dirty rag at the face of the person. (Virtues of Salah Part 3 ( c ) Hadith No.2Pg84)Hadrat Huzaifah (Radiallahu anhu) says that whenever Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) happened to face any difficulty he would at once resort to Salah.(Virtues of Salah Part I( a) Hadith no.5 Pg17)Hadrat Ubadah Ibn Samit (Radiallahu anhu) narrates “My dear friend Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) while enjoining upon me seven good practices said “Do not ascribe anything as partner to ALLAH though you may be cut into pieces or burnt alive or crucified. Do not forego Salah intentionally lest you should get out of the fold Islam. Do not perpetrate disobedience of ALLAH lest you deserve his wrath. Do not take to drinking for that is the mother of all evils. (Virtues of Salah Part I( b ) HadithNo.2Pg 34)Hadrat Naufil Ibn Muawiyah (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “A person who has missed one Salah is like one who has lost all his family and wealth.” (Virtues of the SalahPart I (b) Hadith no.4Pg 36)It is said in a Hadith that ALLAH bestows five favors on a person who is mindful of his Salah:a) His daily bread is made easy for him.b) He is saved from the punishment in the grave.c) He shall receive his record (of deeds) in his right hand on the day of Judgment.d) He shall cross the Pull-e- Sirat with the speed of lightning.e) He shall enter Paradise with a speed of lightning. (Virtues of Salah Part I ( b ) Hadith No.7Pg 40)According to one Hadith there is healing in Salah. Once Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saw Hadrat Abu Hurairah (Radiallahu anhu) lying on his stomach. He said to him “Are you suffering from stomach pain?” He replied in the affirmative. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said “Then get up and busy yourself in Salah for that will heal you. (Virtues of Salah Part I (b ) Hadith No 8 Pg 47)Once the Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) in his dream saw Paradise and heard the footsteps of Hadrat Bilal (Radiallahu anhu). Next morning he asked Billal (Radiallahu anhu) Which deed of yours helped you to follow me even to Paradise?” He replied “When my Wudu breaks even at night I take a fresh Wudu and say as many Rakats of Nafl Salah as I can.” (Virtues of Salah PartI ( b ) Pg 46 Last Page of Hadith 7)Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said “A person neglecting his Salah (even though he makes up for it later) shall remain in Hell for a period of one Huqb. A Huqb is equal to 80 years of 365 days each and a day in the Hereafter shall equal 1000 years of this world.” (Virtues of Salah Part I (b ) Hadith No.8 Pg 47)Hadrat Anas bin Malik (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “A person who in all sincerity is constant in his Salah with Jamaat for forty days without missing the first Takbit receives two awards: One for deliverance from Hell and the other for freedom from Nifaq (Hypocrisy).” (Virtues of Salah Part 2 (a) Hadith No.4 Pg 56)Hadrat Ibn abbas (Radiallahu anhu) narrates “I heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “If a person in spite of hearing the Azan does not go to the Masjid (and he prefers to say his Salah at home) without a strong excuse then his Salah is not accepted. When the Companions asked as to what could be a strong excuse? He replied “Illness or Fear.” (Virtues of Salah Ch 2 Hadith No.1Pg 61)Hadrat Abu Hurairah (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “I wish I could ask the boys to collect a huge quantity of firewood for me and then I would go around and set fire to the dwellings of those who say their Salah at own houses without any excuse.” (Virtues of Salah Part 2Hadith No.3Pg 63)Hadrat Qubath Ibn Ashyam Laithi (Radiallahu anhu) said that he heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying “Two persons performing Salah together with one as an Imam are liked by ALLAH more than four persons saying Salah individually. Similarly four persons performing Salah with Jamaat are liked by ALLAH more than eight persons saying it individually. Similarly again eight persons performing Salah with Jamaat are liked by ALLAH more than 100 persons saying it individually.” (Virtues of Salah Part 2 (a) Hadith No.4 Pg 57)Hadrat Abdullah Ibn Abu Qatadah (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) once said “The worse thief is one who steals from his Salah.” The companions inquired “How can one steal from his Salah? “He remarked: “When one does not do his Ruku and Sajdah properly.” (Virtues of SalahPart3 ( c ) Hadith No.5PG 87)Abu Muslim (Rahmatullah Alaih) narrates “I want to see Abu Umamah (Radiallahu anhu) while he was in the Masjid. I asked him if he had really heard Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Saying “When a person performs Wudu with right performance and says his Fard Salah ALLAH forgives him all the sins committed that day by his feet in going towards evil by his hands in doing evil by his ears in listening to evil by his eyes in looking at evil and by his heart in thinking of evil.” He replied “By ALLAH I heard these works from Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) again and again.”It is said of Imam Abu Hanifah (Rahmatullah Alaih) that he could tell from the water falling down from the limbs of the person performing Wudu as to which sins had been washed off therewith. (Virtues of Salah Part I (a) Hadith No.4 Pg 21)There are many sayings of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) enjoining Salah and explaining its virtue.

3,IlmActivity,ILM & ZIKAR INTRODUCTION : Say can those with (spiritual) knowledge be equal to those who do not have knowledge? Only those with (spiritual) intelligence (wisdom) will heed (good advice). (Surah Zumar Verse 9)And say Oh my Rabb! Increase my knowledge. (Surah Ta Ha Verse 114)It is Fard on every male and female to acquire basic knowledge of Din. One should know what is halal and what is haram. One must be able to distinguish between right and wrong. Ilm is to recognize what ALLAH requires of us from our 24 hour daily life. ALLAH says to Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Say to them. Can those who have knowledge (of Din) be equal to those who do not have knowledge? (Surah Zumar Verse 9)O you who have Iman! Remember ALLAH in abundance and glorify Him morning and evening. (Surah Ahzab Verse 41-42)Those who have Iman and whose hearts are contented with the remembrance of ALLAH. Behold! Hearts are contented with the remembrance of ALLAH. (Surah Ra’d Verse 28)The object of Zikr is that a person must become aware and conscious of the presence of ALLAH at all times and at every second of the day. This awareness will come about by making continuous Zikr of ALLAH man being the best of creation should also make the Zikr of ALLAH.

4,IkramActivity,IKRAM UL MUSLIM INTRODUCTION : And those (the Ansar) who adopted the place (Madinah) as their home before them (the Muhajirin) and (had adopted) Iman. They (Ansar) love those (Muhajirin) who migrated to them and find no want (jealousy envy) in their hearts for what they (the Muhajirin) are given. They (The Ansar) prefer (others) above themselves even though they are themselves in need. (Surah Hashr v 9)Through worship we will receive reward and through Ikramul Muslim we will gain ALLAH. If we have ALLAH we have everything. Every Muslim should realize the rights of others as well as the rights of ALLAH’s creatures. We should always be polite kind and humble towards them.Remember: Love for others what we would love for ourselves. The only way we can acquire this quality of ourselves. The only way we can acquire this quality of Ikram is by placing the needs of others before our own needs. Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) on their death beds as well would put the needs of others in front of their own needs.

5,NiyyahActivity,IKHLASUN NIYYAH INCIDENTS : Abdullah Ibn Umar (Radiallahu anhu) narrates “I heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying: “Three people of an Ummah before you set out on a journey and they took refuge in a cave to spend the night. A rock slid from the mountain and blocked the cave. They said “Indeed you cannot be relieved from this rock except that you invoke ALLAH on the basis of your good deeds.” So one of them said “O ALLAH I had very Aged parents and I would not give milk to my children and other member of my family and slaves before my parents.One day I went far away in quest of seeking wood and I could not return to my parents before they had slept. I milked the evening milk for them and found that they were asleep. I disliked giving milk to my children and other members of my family and slaves to drink before them. So I stood by them with the bowl of milk in my hand waiting for them to wake up while my children were crying at my feet out of hunger up till it dawned. Then my parents woke up and they drank their evening’s share of the milk. O ALLAH! If I had done so to please you relieve us from the distress imposed upon us by this rock.” So the rock moved a little resulting in a small opening but not enough for them to get out. Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) then said the second person said “O ALLAH! I had a cousin whom I loved more than anybody. I desired to satisfy my lust with her but she refused. Subsequently a year of famine and drought forced her to approach me. I gave her one hundred and twenty Dinars on the condition that she would yield herself to me. So she agreed and when I was able to get a hold on her she said: It is not permitted for you to break the seal of virginity except by its lawful right (that by marriage) I restrained myself from her though she was the most beloved of people to me and I left the Dinars with her. Oh ALLAH! if I had done so to please you then relieve us from the distress that we are suffering.” So again the rock moved a little resulting in a small opening but again they were unable to get out.Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) then said that the third one invoked. “Oh ALLAH! I hired the service of some laborers and paid all of them their wages except one who departed without taking what was due to him. I invested his wages in a business of camels cattle sheep and slaves and the business prospered immensely. He came back to me after a longtime and said “O slave of ALLAH! Pay me my due.” I replied “all that you see is yours: camels cattle sheep and slaves.” He said “O salve of ALLAH! Do not make fun of me.” So I said “I am not joking with you!” Then he took all of it and drove it away not leaving anything. “O ALLAH! If I had done so to please you then relieve us from this distress.” So the rock moved aside and they all got out walking. (Muntakhab ahadith Ikhlas Hadith No 8 Pg.533)Hadrat Abu Hurairah (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said a man said “Indeed I will give charity secretly!” He came out with his charity and placed it in the hands of a thief. In the morning people began to talk and say “Charity was given to a thief.” The man said “O ALLAH! All praise is to you! I will indeed give charity!” And he came out with his charity and placed it in the hands of an adulteress. In the morning the people began to talk and say: “Charity was given to an adulteress last night.” The man said “O ALLAH! All praise is for you in giving charity to an adulteress I will surely give charity!” He came out with charity and placed it in the hands of a rich man. In the morning the people began to talk and say “Charity was given to a rich man!” The man said “O ALLAH! All praise is for you in giving charity to a thief an adulteress and a rich man. He then had a dream in which he was told that his charity was made to be given to a thief may perhaps result in his refraining from stealing to the adulteress so that she may perhaps refrain from adultery and to the rich man so that he may perhaps pay heed and spend from what ALLAH has given him.Note: Because of this man’s sincerity ALLAH accepted all three of this man’s. (Muntakhab ahadith Ikhlas HadithNo.7 Pg 531)Hadrat Abu Hurairah (Radiallahu anhu) narrates “I heard Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying the first amongst the people against whom judgment will be pronounced on the day of Resurrection will be a Martyr. He will be brought forward. ALLAH will remind him of his favors and he will acknowledge them. ALLAH will ask “What did you do (to show gratitude) for these favors?” He will reply “I fought for you until I was a martyr.” ALLAH will say “You have lied! You have fought to be called brave so it has been said!” command will then be issued about him. He will be dragged on his face until he will be cast into the fire.Next a man who had learnt and taught knowledge and recited the Quran will be brought forward. ALLAH will remind him of his favors and he will acknowledge them. ALLAH will ask. “What did you do (to show gratitude) for these favors?” He will reply. “I learnt and taught (religious) knowledge and recited the Quran for your sake.” ALLAH will say: “You have lied. You acquired to be called learned. You recited the Quran to be called a Qari (reciter of the Quran) so you have been called such. A command will then be issued about him. He will be dragged on his face until he will be cast into the fire.Next a man whom ALLAH had made wealthy and to whom he had given all kinds o riches will be brought forward. ALLAH will remind him of his favors and he will acknowledge them. ALLAH will ask “What did you do (to show gratitude) for these favors?” he will reply. “I left no cause in which you like money to be spent except that I spent it for your sake.” ALLAH will say “You have lied you did so to be called generous so it has been said.” A command will then be issued about him. He will be dragged on his face and cast into fire.” (Muntkhab Ahadith Ikhlas Hadith 41 Pg 550).May ALLAH save us.[Ameen] VIRTUES,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.TextView android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.TextView

Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) sat by his head and said to him “Accept Islam.” He looked at his father who was beside him. His father said “Obey Abul Qasim!” so he accepted Islam. At this Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) came out saying “All praise is to ALLAH who has saved him from the fire. (Muntakhab Ahadith Hadith No 14 Pg 577)Hadrat Sahal Ibn Sa’ad (Radiallahu anhu) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said “If the world was worth a mosquito’s wing to ALLAH He would not have given the disbelievers even a sip of water.”(Muntakhab Ahadith Hadith No 51 Pg 697 INCIDENTS,android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ScrollView android.widget.TextView android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.LinearLayout android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.RelativeLayout android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.ImageButton android.widget.TextView

9,CompanionActivity,Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said that my Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) are like guiding stars. Whomsoever you follow you will be rightly guided (stories of Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) Ch.12 Pg 264 No.2)ALLAH has praised the Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) and expressed his pleasure with them in the following verse of the QuranALLAH is pleased with them and they are pleased with him.Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) has said “The likeness of my Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) is as the likeness of salt in food without salt” (i.e the beauty of this deen cannot be understood without the example of the Sahabah). (Stories of Sahabah Ch.12 Pg 265 No.3)It comes in a Hadith: “On the person who reviles my Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) rests in the curse of ALLAH and of Angels and of men combined. Neither his Fard nor his Nafl is accepted by ALLAH. (Stories of Sahabah Ch.12 Pg 265 No.6)Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said “Every condition that afflicted the Banu Israil will certainly afflict my Ummah as well. The banu Israil were split into 72 groups. My Ummah will split into 73. All these are headed for Jahannam except one.” The Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) asked “Which group will this be O Rasullahllah?” Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) replied “The one that follows my way and the way of my Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu).” (Hayatus Sahabah v.1 Pg 46)Nabi (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) has said on the day of resurrection I shall be the guardian of those who have regard in their dealing with my Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu). (Stories of Sahabah Ch.12 Pg 266 No.10)The Sahabah (Radiallahu anhu) possessed many sterling qualities in their lives. However each one of them basically possessed six distinct qualities which do not constitute the entire Din but if we endeavor to inculcate these qualities into our lives then to bring the entire deen into our lives will become very easy In shaa ALLAH.
