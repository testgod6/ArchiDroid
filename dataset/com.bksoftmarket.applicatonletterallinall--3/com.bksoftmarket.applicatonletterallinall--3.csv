10,b6,My Salam to you and mother. Hope you all are keeping well by the grace of almighty. I am also well. I have not heard any news for a long time. I could not write to you during the long period. But today I could not but write to you to tell you good news. You will be glad to know that I stood first in the final Model test of our school. You know I could not do very well in the pre-test examination. But after it was over I began to study vigorously. I got 80% marks only in Mathematics .I thought about it seriously. I found no subject hard to me. Earlier I did not study on any subject very seriously except Mathematics. Before our test examination I studied very well for two months. Every day I started to study at 6:30 p.m. closing the door of my reading room and continued up to 12:00 (midnight) with a gap of 20 minutes for supper in the middle. Every morning I checked what I learnt the previous night through writing. I just placed the questions on the table and wrote their answers within a fixed time. After that I myself assessed them with the help of the answers prepared earlier by my subject teachers. You can say I was in deep study while night and I sat for exam in every morning. The practiced helped me so much that I have done quite well in the Model test held after the test examination of our school. I can assure you that if God wishes I can fulfill your expectation in the coming examination. Now I am quite hopeful of having my SSC result with GPA 5.In the final Model Test I got grade point 5 in every subject. And in my most favorite subjects Mathematics and Physics I got 100 and 97 marks respectively. This is all about how I prepared for the coming SSC examination. Convey my Salam to mother and love to the younger.

I hope you will do a brilliant result in the examination. This time is the best time to be prepared for the ensuring examination. You know now days there is a bad tendency among the students not to study but to adopt unfair means in the examination. It cannot make them perfect. It will not be able to offer them real education. But I would like to make you cautious that you should never try to adopt unfair means in the examination. It is really crime which spoils a student forever. One may pass the examination by adopting unfair means but his future life is full of darkness. This is one thing that will break down their career .If they cannot pass first time they can try next. I think failure is more acceptable than adopting unfair means. Follow my advice and you will be succeeded and benefited. No more to day. Convey my regards to parents and love to the younger.

No nation can prosper without education. But it is a matter of sorrow that most of the people of our country are illiterate and ignorant. They do not know how to read and write. They have no knowledge of health family planning and scientific method of cultivation. So I and some of my friends decided that we would remove illiteracy and ignorance from our village. Finally we implemented our plan and spent the whole vacation in teaching the illiterate villagers. No more today. Please write to me.

Paper The television is a wonderful gift of science. Indeed it is one of the seven wonders of modern science. An English scientist named Bayard invented the television in 1926. But the system had to be gradually improved by many other scientists before it could be successfully utilised by Bayard to make the modern television. How the system works: Television combines televised scenes with a take to reproducing sounds. This is done by installing a radio telephones at the two ends are thus able to hear and see each other. At the receiving station both the vision and the sound signals are made to pass through a radio frequency amplifier and frequency changer with the result that the signals devise themselves. In fact the television is a system which employs mechanical photo electrical and photo electrical and wireless processes for reproducing scene object etc. at a distance. In many ways the method has the likeness to that of the cinema. The difference is that in the cinema pictures on a long film are reproduced while in the television an actual moving figures: i. e. the face of a speaker or of an actor is reproduced. Its importance: Television is a great improvement over the radio. Only by hearing a man’s speaking we may not understand him fully but we both see and hear him his speech is likely to produce greater effect on our minds. It is thus clear that the television has a very great importance. Its growing popularity shows that it can be an effective instrument of entertainment and valuable medium of instruction. In western countries it has already been playing this role with greater and greater success. In Bangladesh a Television station has been set up at Dhaka. It is hoped that this powerful organ of entertainment and instruction will have a network throughout the country before long. Conclusion: Television is a popular invention of modern science. It is however very costly. Television Various types of birds fly trees to trees in our country. Our minds fill up with the pleasure of chirping of the birds. The Doel is our national bird among uncountable numbers of birds. Appearance: The Doel is a small bird in size. It goes always raising its tail. There are long spots of white colour in its tail. In the neck there is a wreath. To the bird is much liked. Some of the Doels have long spots of white and black under its chest. The body of it is covered with soft feather. The male Doel is glitter in colour. There are nails in the top of the legs. The colours of its legs are brown. Food and living place: They live on various kinds of worms and insects. They eat pulse mustard lentil sesamum etc. the Doels live in the holes of trees. They also live in bushes of trees. In the winter morning they hop and chirp again and again in guava tree in lemon tree and in the pools of bean and take worms and insects. Generally in summer it lays eggs of blue colour making nests in the holes of trees. Dignity of national bird: There are few birds like sweet voice of Doel. The Doel can imitate voice of other birds. The Doel is very neat and clean. Without this the Doel is found all over our Bangladesh. For these reasons the robin or the Doel is got the dignity of our national bird. Usefulness: The Doel does not any harm to us. But it benefits to us eating various worms and insects. The sweet chirping of the Doel harmed us. This is a member of national beauties. The flesh of Doel is taste. Sometime the cruel prayers catch the Doel and get money to sell. Conclusion: Though the Doel is a small bird it has a great value. So we should be kind to it. The government should prohibit catching the Doel by law. National Bird of Bangladesh Animals that people tame in their house are called domestic animals.

Importance of neighbours: Man is a social being. He does not live in a forest like an animal unless he is a savage or a saint. Of course there was a time when men live in the forests like animals. Then none could think for others. Self-preservation was his only thought at that time. Gradually men realized the advantage of living together. It was necessary for their existence. Otherwise they were unable to protect themselves from the attacks of wild animals. So they formed society and learnt to live together as neighbours. Our neighbours are our companions in prosperity and adversity. We get more help from them than our close relations. So we gave our duties and responsibilities to our neighbours because they are our constant companions. Duty towards neighbours: It is our duty to treat our neighbours well. We should share in their joys and sorrows. We should stand by them and give them courage and protection in danger. We should attend upon them when they ate sick.

Many other scientists’ improved the system before it could be used as the modern radio. What it is: There is something in the air called ether which carries sound to our ears. But the waves of this ether become fainter and fainter as they travel farther. So it cannot carry the sound to a distant place. Radio is the instrument by which we can hear the sound from any part of the world. How it works: There are powerful radio stations in all bag cities in the world. In Bangladesh Dhaka Rajshahi Chittagong Khulna Sylhet and Rangpur have radio transmitting sets. As soon as a sound is made the microphone catches it and the transmitter broadcasts it in the air.

33,b12,I would like to share my experience of the air journey with you. My first flight is a memorable event of my life. I received a letter from my uncle at Chittagong together with a plane ticket. He asked me to go there and stay with them for a couple of days. The ticket was a Fokker flight on September 30 2004. I reached the Zia international Airport about one hour before the flight. I had my ticket checked and my luggage weighed and took the boarding card. After about fifteen minutes the flight was announced. Going along with other passengers towards the tarmac I boarded the plane. My seat was by the side of a window. Just in front of me there was a sign with the words: fasten your seat belt. No smoking.” After a few minutes the plane moved along the run way and then began to take off. I saw outside. The houses below looked like doll houses the paddy fields looked like green carpets and the rivers appeared as broad lines on a drawing sheet. The air hostess came with a tray in her hand and gave some light and delicious refreshments. In about 40 minutes the plane landed at Chittagong Airport and we came to our journey’s end. It was an enjoyable that filled my heart with thrill and excitement. It brought a change and recreation in my monotonous life. No more today.

The word paper came from the word papyrus which was a leaf of a plant. History: Perhaps it was first made in china. Some claim that paper was first introduced in Egypt. How made: It is made of rags bamboos straw wood and other things. This are cleaned and cut into small pieces and kept under water to make tem soft. Then they are boiled with soda to remove dirt.

Paper The television is a wonderful gift of science. Indeed it is one of the seven wonders of modern science. An English scientist named Bayard invented the television in 1926. But the system had to be gradually improved by many other scientists before it could be successfully utilised by Bayard to make the modern television. How the system works: Television combines televised scenes with a take to reproducing sounds. This is done by installing a radio telephones at the two ends are thus able to hear and see each other. At the receiving station both the vision and the sound signals are made to pass through a radio frequency amplifier and frequency changer with the result that the signals devise themselves. In fact the television is a system which employs mechanical photo electrical and photo electrical and wireless processes for reproducing scene object etc. at a distance. In many ways the method has the likeness to that of the cinema. The difference is that in the cinema pictures on a long film are reproduced while in the television an actual moving figures: i. e. the face of a speaker or of an actor is reproduced. Its importance: Television is a great improvement over the radio. Only by hearing a man’s speaking we may not understand him fully but we both see and hear him his speech is likely to produce greater effect on our minds. It is thus clear that the television has a very great importance. Its growing popularity shows that it can be an effective instrument of entertainment and valuable medium of instruction. In western countries it has already been playing this role with greater and greater success. In Bangladesh a Television station has been set up at Dhaka. It is hoped that this powerful organ of entertainment and instruction will have a network throughout the country before long. Conclusion: Television is a popular invention of modern science. It is however very costly. Television Various types of birds fly trees to trees in our country. Our minds fill up with the pleasure of chirping of the birds. The Doel is our national bird among uncountable numbers of birds. Appearance: The Doel is a small bird in size. It goes always raising its tail. There are long spots of white colour in its tail. In the neck there is a wreath. To the bird is much liked. Some of the Doels have long spots of white and black under its chest. The body of it is covered with soft feather. The male Doel is glitter in colour. There are nails in the top of the legs. The colours of its legs are brown. Food and living place: They live on various kinds of worms and insects. They eat pulse mustard lentil sesamum etc. the Doels live in the holes of trees. They also live in bushes of trees. In the winter morning they hop and chirp again and again in guava tree in lemon tree and in the pools of bean and take worms and insects. Generally in summer it lays eggs of blue colour making nests in the holes of trees. Dignity of national bird: There are few birds like sweet voice of Doel. The Doel can imitate voice of other birds. The Doel is very neat and clean. Without this the Doel is found all over our Bangladesh. For these reasons the robin or the Doel is got the dignity of our national bird. Usefulness: The Doel does not any harm to us. But it benefits to us eating various worms and insects. The sweet chirping of the Doel harmed us. This is a member of national beauties. The flesh of Doel is taste. Sometime the cruel prayers catch the Doel and get money to sell. Conclusion: Though the Doel is a small bird it has a great value. So we should be kind to it. The government should prohibit catching the Doel by law. National Bird of Bangladesh Animals that people tame in their house are called domestic animals.

Importance of neighbours: Man is a social being. He does not live in a forest like an animal unless he is a savage or a saint. Of course there was a time when men live in the forests like animals. Then none could think for others. Self-preservation was his only thought at that time. Gradually men realized the advantage of living together. It was necessary for their existence. Otherwise they were unable to protect themselves from the attacks of wild animals. So they formed society and learnt to live together as neighbours. Our neighbours are our companions in prosperity and adversity. We get more help from them than our close relations. So we gave our duties and responsibilities to our neighbours because they are our constant companions. Duty towards neighbours: It is our duty to treat our neighbours well. We should share in their joys and sorrows. We should stand by them and give them courage and protection in danger. We should attend upon them when they ate sick. We should help our poor neighbours with money and lessen their distress. We should feed them when they are in need of. If any of our neighbours happens to be wicked we should do our best tom rectify him. We should not hate our neighbours in any way. Conclusion: Thus we find that a good neighbour is a great boon to a man. So all of us should try to be good neighbours and help one another in all possible ways.

Some fishermen have nets but no boats. Some who have boats and nets employ the boat less ones and work in a group. A fisherman is always at work. While at home he repairs his boats or nets and he paints his boats or dyes his nets. He catches fish in the seas rivers and beels. His women-folk make new nets; his children dry fishes in the sun and sell them in the market. He works hard all day and night. The life of a fisherman is very risky and challenging because there may have storms and cyclones at any time. Some fishermen go to fish at night; some go to fish in the deep water or in the sea from home for many days. When he catches a lot of fish his joy knows no bounds. After all a fisherman does much good to us by supplying fishes. In spite of being hard working he can hardly make both ends meet. Government should take some steps for the development of minimum standard of their livelihood. A Fisherman A man who sells various things by moving from street to street is a street hawker.

A Garment Worker Arsenic pollution means arsenic contaminated water. Of late arsenic pollution has become one of the most health hazards in Bangladesh. By drinking arsenic water people get the disease. Arsenic is a fatal poison. It has been deposited in that layer of the soil from here our tube-wells pump out water. As a result in most areas of Bangladesh tube-well water in contaminated with arsenic. Arsenic pollution has made the scarcity of drinking water acute though our country is water-rich. The irony of fate is that “water neither water everywhere nor a drop to drink.” It is a hard nut to crack. Our ignorant people are drinking arsenic polluted water from tube wells and are human being affected by arsenicosis. Those who do not eat fish and vegetables are easily affected. Arsenic is such a poison that is damages all the vital organs ore after another resulting in the subsequent death of the sufferer. Arsenicosis has no remedy nor has it any antidote. Hence arsenic pollution demands utmost attention. An affected person should drink arsenic free water and take vitamins A C E to come round. Arsenic polluted water has been ter5med as the killing water. There has been worldwide awareness of this problem. Aids from different corners are reaching. Deep tube wells rainwater reservoirs surface water treatment etc. may be the pragmatic measures to minimize the problem to a great extent. Arsenic pollution Dowry means property or money brought by a bride to her husband when they get married .Now a days the system of giving and taking dowry in marriage is more prevalent in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh this is seen to be major problem. In the Bangladeshi society this system is treated as a serious problem. Wife is inhumanly tortured and killed by her husband for dowry. Most of the parents are poor. They cannot keep up their word they give before marrying off their daughters. This leads to chaos and hellish unhappiness. However the first thing to be done to stop this malpractice is to grow awareness among all. Movement against dowry system should declare right now. We cannot get rid of this social vice by taking social reformative works urgently. Dowry system Mobile phone is an important medium of communication and correspondence which helps intercommunication with the people in the shortest possible time. The use of mobile phone is more convenient than telephone call. The man who sends the message will have to pay the bill but the receiver can respond to the message without any payment. Especially businessmen and the serviceman are much benefited through the use of mobile phone. It is useful for the doctor businessman and high officials. But it is also useful for the people who is shopping and supplying in valuable information in his house. Sometimes the criminals are using this phone to maintain their society. By using the Mobile phone the terrorists and criminals carry out their evil designs and commit crimes with much difficulty. In spite of this there is no better alternative to mobile phone making the latest civilization for communication and correspondence. Mobile Phone The man who delivers letters parcels and money orders from door to door is a postman. A postman is very punctual and dutiful. The works of a postman begins in the morning. He wears a different dress and it is a khaki uniform. The postman carries across his shoulders a bag containing letters parcels and money orders and other postal articles. He is very useful to the people and his work is very important and responsible. He goes from one house to another to deliver letters money orders and other postal articles to the proper addresses. A postman can make us both happy and unhappy. When he brings letters of good news we become happy. He renders and great service to the society. He is such a great friend to us that everybody we expect his nock on the door. He behaves amiably with all. The economic condition of a postman is very miserable. Though he works very hard he gets a very small salary. With it he cannot maintain his family decently. So he leads a miserable life. No doubt he serves the society as well as the country greatly in the field of postal communication. He should be given good salary so that he can lead a better life and service us well. The Postman Every student has to study in different institutions in different spheres of life. Accordingly I left my school for higher studies. Before leaving school I want to recall some events concerning my school. My last day at school is a memorable day to me. The students of our school bade us farewell on this day. The hall room was nicely decorated. Separate arrangement was made for us to sit. Our respected teachers took their seat on this dais. One of our teachers called out our names. We went up the dais one by one and the students gave us flowers and the headmaster gave the copy of “YOU WILL WIN” By Shib Kahake. With the gift we took our seats. Students delivered their short speech and begged forgiveness for our misdeed if any. Our teachers gave us valuable advice. The function being over we were entertained with refreshment. Then left the school compound. Standing on the road I looked back home with a heavy heart. My last day at school Internet is a computerized network of information. It is the greatest invention in the communication system. It is the worldwide network of computer. Its uses and functions are smooth easy and rapid. A students who knows just the keys of computer can communicate anywhere he wishes. Internet communication is now the latest communication in the world. A computer and a telephone connection are required to get an Internet connection. There are two types of Internet such as Dial up and Broad Band. Internet has great usefulness. To get appropriate information a person has to communicate in the appropriate address. One can also go to a search engine like Yahoo Goggle for finding particular page or a piece of information. A search engine is a system through which you can search for information on Web pages containing that information. By using Internet students can go through several books from the libraries without going there. They can seek information regarding admission to different foreign universities. But it is a matter to sorrow that many people of Bangladesh do not have still access to Internet because it is still costly and not easily available. Internet All the ingredients that we have around us are jointly known as environment. Environment pollution implies the contamination of the surroundings. Any abnormal change of environment in chemical physical and biological characteristics in environment is called environment pollution. Environment is the whole system of our existence. Our environment is becoming polluted every day for several reasons. Human beings mainly pollute environment. Massive industrialization is an important cause of environment. Smoke from motor vehicles also pollutes environment. Serious environment pollution occurs in big cities because buses trucks and cars play in the streets every day and emit smoke. Mills and factories also pollute water. They throw their waste products into rivers and canals. By burning wood and melting pitch for road construction people make more smoke and pollute air. We use pesticide in our crop fields. It also pollutes our environment. Indiscriminate cutting of trees has also turned unbalanced environment. The ecological balance is being lost as a result of environment pollution. If we all desire to live a healthy and tranquillized life we should make our environment clean and free from pollution. We should be all whole-heartedly in keeping our environment fit for habitation. Environment Pollution Traffic jam is a situation in where vehicles cannot move freely and traffic comes to a standstill. It occurs almost all the district towns where a lot of vehicles play every day. Especially it occurs near bus stand railway crossing and turn of a road at the junction of various roads or near a market. It occurs mainly in the morning and afternoon on working days when everyday body tries to attend office in short time or returns home as early as possible. The indiscriminate playing of vehicles like rickshaws bus scoters etc. and haphazard parking of vehicles and small shops in the footpaths are the main reason of traffic jam. Traffic jam causes untold sufferings to people. Students cannot reach schools in time. It kills our time and lessons our working hours. It causes great sufferings to the ambulance carrying dying patients and the fire brigade vehicles. The increasing of traffic jam hampers our economy. So well spacious roads should be constructed. One-way movement of vehicles should be introduced. The driver should be trained in order to cope with the other developed nations. After doing all these things we can hope to have a good traffic system for our easy and comfortable movement.

My class teacher took me to the classroom and introduced to my classmates. I met with the teachers and students who behaved well with me. My classmates were very much friendly and soon they accepted me as one of their bosom friend. They received me very cordially and made friendship with me within a short time.
