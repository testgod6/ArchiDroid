Exceptionally we use past tense if the 'situation' happens right after the 'action'. •‌ I dropped my credit card while I was looking for my keys. ‌• I saw you in the mall yesterday when you were waiting in the line. ‌• Bobby hurt his ankle when he was playing soccer. ‌We use the past simple and the past continuous to say an action interrupted another action: We use the past continous to express 'situations' that continues some time (cleaningdriving etc.) but the past simple expresses 'actions' that happen quickly.(droppedcut etc.) ‌• He didn't notice me when I was calling his name. ‌• What were you doing at 8 PM yesterday? ‌• This time last year I was studying at university .
